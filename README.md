# üë®üèª‚ÄçüíªüõçÔ∏è ECommerceCore

**ECommerceCore** is the final exam project for the Advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course in C++ at IT Step Computer Academy. It is designed to showcase a culmination of skills and concepts learned throughout the course.

## üìö Description
This console application serves as the backend of an e-commerce platform, simulating real-world functionality while embodying essential OOP principles, design patterns, and modern C++ best practices.

## üéØ Focus:
**OOP Principles**: The project is all about using OOP principles like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. It's structured to make the code easy to read, update, and manage.

**Handle Complex JSON**: Efficiently parse and process complex JSON data using a suitable library [nlohmann::json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json). Validate incoming JSON against a schema to ensure data integrity.

**Design Patterns and C++ Features**: The project utilizes different design patterns and modern C++ features to make the code better. This includes things like smart pointers for memory management and the Standard Template Library (STL) for working with data.

**Incorporate Best Practices**: Adhere to C++ style guides (e.g., [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)) for consistent formatting and readability.


## ü¶æ Main Features

* **Approach to storing user data using JSON** </br> ---> *It is important to note that this method is not secure and should not be implemented in real-world applications. The information displayed is purely for illustrative purposes and does not represent actual user accounts; similarly, the application utilizes this approach exclusively for academic purposes* <---

```json
{
    "a": [
        {
            "password": "99@tOHL9wdmXs",
            "username": "sludchpo"
        }
    ],
    "b": [
        {
            "password": "99@VkZeC79JvE",
            "username": "vuyclglx"
        }
    ],
    "c": [
        {
            "password": "99@ouDAbzZ%gu",
            "username": "hbvmdgwf"
        }
    ]
}
```
* **Signing up / logging in** </br> *Example of logging in process:*
```cpp
// Validate both username and password
        try {
            validateName(username);
            validatePassword(password);
        }
        catch (const std::invalid_argument& exception) {
            // Here it states that user doesn't exist because if, when signing up,
            // user didn't pass the validation, they could not register,
            // so invalid usernames or passwords are not in auth.json
            throw std::invalid_argument("User does not exist");
        }

        std::ifstream jsonFileRead("...");
        json readData;
        if (jsonFileRead.is_open())
        {
            try {
                jsonFileRead >> readData;
                jsonFileRead.close();
            }
            catch (json::parse_error& e) {
                std::cout << e.what() << std::endl;
                throw;
            }

            // If data has been read, proceed by iterating over JSON object
            for (auto& [key, user] : readData.items())
            {
                // Compare the key (which is the letter we group users by),
                // with the first letter of given username
                if (key[0] == username[0])
                {
                    // If found, now iterate over JSON object,
                    // and compare username and password given with those object has
                    for (auto& userData : user)
                    {
                        if (userData["username"] == username && userData["password"] == password)
                        {
                            return true;  // <-- return true if user has been found
                        }
                    }

                    std::cout << "User hasn't been found" << std::endl;
                    return false;  // <-- return false if user hasn't been found
                }
            }
        }
        return false;  // <-- return false if user hasn't been found
    }
```
*Please again note that in this case, for instance, the absolute path to the catalog is not encapsulated and secured due to the reasons discussed in the first feature*

## ‚öôÔ∏è Building

### MacOS / Linux
* Open the terminal in the project directory.
* Generate CMake build files; use: </br>
`cmake ..`

### Windows 
* `cmake -G "Visual Studio 17"` to generate Visual Studio solution files.
* Instead of -G Visual Studio 17, you can use `-G "MinGW Makefiles"`. This generates Makefiles compatible with MinGW, a free and open-source C/C++ compiler suite for Windows. Users can then build the project using a command-line tool like mingw32-make.

Once the build files are generated, you can proceed to build and run your application.

### Note: 
* For detailed build instructions and troubleshooting, refer to the [CMake documentation](https://cmake.org/)
* If you encounter issues, search online forums or communities for help with CMake specifically on your platform.
